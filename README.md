# Simple Jeopardy! Score Tracker

Track a small group of people playing Jeopardy! where you can *only add* correctly answered questions (there's no subtraction for missed answers) and the associated dollar values.

Data never leaves your device as all data is stored and processed entirely on the client in vanilla javascript (and PouchDB to manage localstorage). If you dump your cache all the info will be erased. This is just meant to light-heartedly and temporarily track random Jeopardy! games among 3-4 people.

*You can't share games among the group as tracking is limited to each device.*
*I literally spent 4 hours on this, and only did it for my own usage and how I play Jeopardy! with my family, _so your milage may vary.*
_Doesn't work on Firefox!_
